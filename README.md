## Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This Project is a part of Udacity Self Driving Car nanodegree program.
This project consists of a trained and validated model, that can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).


This project repository consists of: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report (markdown) 


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
To try this project in any machine, the Udacity Term1 starter kit can be used, to set up the environment:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)


### Dataset and Repository

1. [Download](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) the data set. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
